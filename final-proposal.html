                For my final project I will be using digital fabrication techniques to design and create moss poles for plants. Moss poles are used for various climbing houseplants. They are made of or contain various substrate for the roots of the plants to grow into and for the plant to support itself. While many different moss poles can be found in different plant stores, they all have one simple design flaw - because the poles are essentially shaped as just a rod, they do not provide any foundational support. As the moss poles get taller and taller, the plant gets heavier, or just as a result of several waterings, the moss poles eventually begin to lean and or become dislodged.

                While digitally fabricated moss poles do exist, many of them perpetuate this basic design flaw and do not provide a foundational base either. While I intend to draw inspiration from other digitally fabricated moss poles, my goal for this project is to design a moss pole that is structurally supported and will not fail over time. I will also be designing clips that can be used with the pole to easily attach a climbing plant to the pole. A stretch goal of mine is to also digitally fabricate decorative toppers that can be added to the tops of the moss poles for aesthetics. My overall design is represented in the below sketch:

                <br>
                <i>Concept sketches. This is a rough modeling of how the final components may be shaped and is not final. Sizes and dimensions are approximated and now drawn to scale. </a></i>
                <br><br>

                My moss pole design consists of four main components, as pictured above, all of which screw into each other.

                <br><br>

                <b>MODULAR MOSS POLE</b>
                <br>
                This is the component of the pole that will actually contain the substrate. It will not be a solid rod, but rather a perforated mesh that will hold the substrate or moss. The top of the moss pole contains a female bolt and the bottom of the moss pole has a male screw. This allows for the moss pole to be screwed into both the anchor adapter and other moss pole sections to further extend it.
                <br><br>
                <b>ANCHOR ADAPTER</b>
                <br>
                The moss pole will potentially be much wider than the anchor extender. This piece allows for the transition between widths and secures the moss pole section to the rest of the pole.
                <br><br>
                <b>ANCHOR EXTENDER</b>
                <br>
                This component can either come in various hieghts or be combined with other anchor extenders to reach the desired hieght. The anchor extenders extend the base of the anchor adapter to the top of the plant container or soil. It is thinner than the moss pole section to both save material and minimize the room the entire moss pole takes up within the pot (leaving more room for soil and dirt).
                <br><br>
                <b>ANCHOR BASE</b>
                <br>
                The base component anchors the moss pole within its container and fits within the base of the container and is held down by the contents of the pot. It contains large cut outs to allow for water drainage. It also contains two mounting options (centered and offset) to support multiple plant and container types. Depending on how this piece sits within the pot, I may need to add additional slits or stilts for better water drainage.
                <br><br><br>

                For the final project I will be fabricating at least one complete moss pole (one of each of the four components). Although, I will be designing the components parametrically so that the moss pole supports multiple standard conatiner sizes. Time permitting, I will print multiple poles for different sized containers. 

                <br><br>
                <img src="Final-Proposal/Pictures/acrylic-clip.png" height=400></a>
                <br>
                The plant clips will be a simple shape, laser cut from acylic. They are intended to push into the moss pole and hold the stem of the plant against the pole. Since these will also be designed parametrically, I intend to explore different widths to support different plant stem sizes.
