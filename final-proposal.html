                For my final project I will be using digital fabrication techniques to design and create moss poles for plants. Moss poles are used for various climbing houseplants. They are made of or contain various substrate for the roots of the plants to grow into and for the plant to support itself. While many different moss poles can be found in different plant stores, they all have one simple design flaw - because the poles are essentially shaped as just a rod, they do not provide any foundational support. As the moss poles get taller and taller, the plant gets heavier, or just as a result of several waterings, the moss poles eventually begin to lean and or become dislodged.

                While digitally fabricated moss poles do exist, many of them perpetuate this basic design flaw and do not provide a foundational base either. While I intend to draw inspiration from other digitally fabricated moss poles, my goal for this project is to design a moss pole that is structurally supported and will not fail over time. I will also be designing clips that can be used with the pole to easily attach a climbing plant to the pole. A stretch goal of mine is to also digitally fabricate decorative toppers that can be added to the tops of the moss poles for aesthetics. My overall design is represented in the below sketch:

                    <li><b>Laser cut</b> plant clips</li>
                    <li>Parametrically design moss pole pieces in <b>Grasshopper and Rhino</b></li>
                    <li><b>3D print</b> moss pole pieces</li>
                    <li><i>Stretch Goal: Design a <b>3D printed</b> mold in <b>Rhino</b> for <b>casting</b> a silicone mold using meshes from Thingiverse</i></li>
                    <li><i>Stretch Goal: <b>Cast</b> decorative moss pole caps that can be attached to the top of the moss poles</i></li>
                </ol>

                <br>

                <i>Stretch goals listed in this section and below are not expected to be achieved 100%. Deviations or incompletion of the stretch goals should not result in point deductions. Rather they are goals that I hope I will have time to complete as "extras" or "nice to haves" for the final assignment.</i>
