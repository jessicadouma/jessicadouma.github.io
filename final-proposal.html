            <h2>Task Breakdown</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Parametrically design plant clips in <b>Grasshopper and Rhino</b></li>
                    <li><b>Laser cut</b> plant clips</li>
                    <li>Parametrically design moss pole pieces in <b>Grasshopper and Rhino</b></li>
                    <li><b>3D print</b> moss pole pieces</li>
                    <li><i>Stretch Goal: Design a <b>3D printed</b> mold in <b>Rhino</b> for <b>casting</b> a silicone mold using meshes from Thingiverse</i></li>
                    <li><i>Stretch Goal: <b>Cast</b> decorative moss pole caps that can be attached to the top of the moss poles</i></li>
                </ol>

                <br>

                <i>Stretch goals listed in this section and below are not expected to be achieved 100%. Deviations or incompletion of the stretch goals should not result in point deductions. Rather they are goals that I hope I will have time to complete as "extras" or "nice to haves" for the final assignment.</i>
