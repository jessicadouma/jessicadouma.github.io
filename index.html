            My name is Jessica Douma! I'm a part-time student in the HCDE master's program, in my final year of the program. For my day job, I'm a software engineer at Microsoft where I currently work on Windows 11 on the Taskbar team. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I'm really excited to <i>finally</i> be taking digital fabrication and go beyond just the software world. I'm especially excited to learn how to 3D print my own designs and products and try them out in the real world. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I'm looking forward to helping my peers with Git/HTML. I don't have a ton of experience in the other domain areas, but I've learned some great software troubleshooting skills over the years as a developer and am happy to help others as I learn more about each of the tools we'll be using.
