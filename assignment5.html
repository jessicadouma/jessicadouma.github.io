            <h2>Let's Get Meshy</h2>
            <p>
                These week we had to explore modifying meshes to produce a single printable STL that pass all the checks for rapid prototyping. I explored <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com">Thingiverse</a> for about 30 minutes looking through different objects hoping to spark an idea of what I wanted to create. I ended up finding some cute pokemon and decided to start there. I went through the following steps to create my modified mesh:
                
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <img src="A5-files/Pictures/import-bulbasaur.png" width=400></a> 
                            <br> 
                            1. Imported the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:327753">bulbasaur STL</a> from Thingiverse into Rhino and verifiied that it was a closed mesh.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <img src="A5-files/Pictures/position-box.png" width=400></a>
                            <br>
                            2. Drew a large box and positioned it above bulbasaur using the Gumball tool, such that it intersected the top of him.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <img src="A5-files/Pictures/mesh-split.png" width=400></a>
                            <br>
                            3. Ran the <i>MeshSplit</i> command on the objects to remove the top part of bulbasaur, using the box as the cutting object.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <img src="A5-files/Pictures/cap.png" width=400></a>
                            <br>
                            4. Step 3 left me with an open mesh, so ran the <i>Cap</i> command on my updated bulbasaur to close it.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <img src="A5-files/Pictures/import-cactus.png" width=400></a>
                            <br>
                            5. Imported one of the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2398762">cactus STL's</a> from Thingiverse into Rhino and verified that it is a closed mesh. When importing, I chose the split disjoint mesh option so that I could easily remove the pot.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <img src="A5-files/Pictures/quad-remesh.png" width=400></a>
                            <br>
                            6. The cactus was very detailed, so I ran the <i>QuadRemesh</i> command on it, with a target polygon count of 2000, and reduced it from ~114,000 polygons to ~11,000.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <img src="A5-files/Pictures/scale.png" width=400></a>
                            <br>
                            7. The cactus was a lot larger than the bulbasaur at this point, so I scaled it down using the <i>Scale</i> command to scale it down by a factor of 0.8.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <img src="A5-files/Pictures/position-cactus.png" width=400></a>
                            <br>
                            8. Next, I rotated, positioned, and angled the cactus over bulbasaur using the Gumball tool such that it was coming out the top of his shell.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            <img src="A5-files/Pictures/final-mesh-rendered.png" width=400></a>
                            <br>
                            9. Lastly, I ran the <i>MeshBooleanUnion</i> command on the two meshes to combine them and re-verified that the mesh was still closed. I then rendered the object to look at my creation and exported it as an STL.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </p>
